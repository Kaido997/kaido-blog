I’ve recently started learning from Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces (OSTEP) by Remzi and Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau. It’s a classic, that takes a very practical approach to understanding how operating systems work — from processes and memory to file systems and concurrency.

My goal is to learn deeply and document what I discover here on this blog. Writing about what I learn helps me remember it better, and maybe it can also help someone else who’s reading OSTEP or exploring systems programming.

I’ll post summaries, explanations in my own words, and small code examples. I’m starting with one of the most fundamental topics: how processes are created and managed using fork() and exec().

Stay tuned — the next post will dive into that!
