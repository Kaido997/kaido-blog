## TL;DR

I’m Alan (Kaido), a CNC programmer and self-taught full-stack developer based in Toronto. I come from a manufacturing background and now focus on
creating web and would like to get into embedded systems. On this blog, I document my projects, lessons, and experiments across web development,
embedded systems, and automation.

Hi! I’m Alan (Kaido) a CNC programmer, full-stack developer, and co-founder based in Toronto, Canada.

My journey into tech started on the factory floor, surrounded by machines and metal. Working as a CNC machinist taught me precision, patience, and
problem-solving the same mindset I now bring to software development.

While working full-time, I followed my passion for coding and completed a Master’s in Blockchain Development at Start2Impact, where I built multiple
real-world projects reviewed by industry professionals. That experience opened the door to software engineering roles in backend, Web3.

Today, I split my time between:

CNC programming in a machine shop, where I optimize machine efficiency with code and automation

Building full-stack web and embedded tools that bridge the gap between the physical and digital worlds

Co-founding Not A Diet, a platform that helps dietitians deliver personalized digital experiences

I use this blog to share my development journey from web apps to IoT experiments and to explore how technology can make real-world work smarter.

If you’re into software, machines, or building things that matter, you’re in the right place.
